# Abstract

The development of video games is the process whereby the necessary elements of a video game are designed and implemented. 
Video game creation is carried out in a multidisciplinary field, which usually involves computer science professionals, designers, graphic artists, musicians and specialists in various aspects of computer engineering (artificial intelligence, physic simulation, etc.).

Nowadays, there is a wide range of devices (mobile phones, tablets, etc.) that have become video game development really popular and, due to this fact, has allowed the birth of a huge community of "indie" developers outside the traditional industry. 
As a consecuence of this phenomena, a considerable amount of courses, masters, and even degrees, have arisen expecting to train new specialists in videogame creation.

The current project comes up with the hope of providing a learning and introductory tool for novice programmers in this field. YAOMEV is based on free standards and tools in order to ease its use and help everyone who is interested in being initiated in this fascinating world.

YAOMEV offers tools to ease the importation of graphics and animations created in the main free software 3D graphics suite (Blender), video and audio reproduction, the player - videogame interaction, the use of structures that allow the use of behavior trees to define the artificial intelligence of the characters, and a complete mathematic library that round up the help offered to the developer.

By building YAOMEV following the guidelines of the Model-View-Controller software architecture pattern, it introduces the developer into software engineering advanced concepts, allowing him to takes care just of the aspects he is really interested in. This way, if the development requires an additional effort in the representation part, the view layer can be improved without harming the rest of the environment, if the need is focused on the input and the processing of the user interaction, the efforts can be concentrated onto the controllers layer, and if the primary aim is the creation of a game, it is possible to skip the previous layers and pay all the attention to the construction of the video game intern model (its rules) by the use of behavior trees.

Finally, a game demo called Bit Them All!!! has ben developed, an educational video game, easily expandable that pretends to be an example of what can be achieved by the use of YAOMEV.
